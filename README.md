This game is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess the number given by oponent(the computer).The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. Each time you enter a number, the computer will tell you whether it is lower or higher than the expected number.

You win the game when your number matches your computers number.

If you give number higher than 100 or lower than 1 it logs: "Invalid input! Try again."

When you guess it the it logs: "You guess it!".
